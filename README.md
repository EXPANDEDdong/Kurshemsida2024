> Make sure your username is between 4 and 36 characters long and only using alphanumerics.  
> The password should also be at least 8 characters long.
## Updating your description
After you have created your account, you might want to change your user description,  
Which will be "User Description" by default.  
To do this you will  have to go to settingsand into the account tab.
